Course Description: The technology driving modern video games has
brought forth new breakthroughs in real-time graphics, simulation, and
artificial intelligence (AI), and has become increasingly common in wide range
of entertainment, robotics, and virtual/augmented reality applications. In this
course, we will cover the key algorithmic techniques that have enabled this

revolution, investigate the trade-offs and limitations inherent in these real-
time approaches, and discuss open problems and current trends in the field.

Topics discussed will include real-time techniques for: physically-based
lighting simulation, artificial intelligence (AI), sound simulation, character
animation, and large-scale rendering.
